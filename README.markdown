# githerpad
an etherpad like webapp, based on node.js and socket.io, for collaborative text editing. documents are saved as flatfiles in a git repository for versioning.
the frontend uses a simple textarea, so it should work on mobile devices too.

## installation
you need node.js
clone this repo, create a "pads" directory and in it create a git repo(not a bare!)
fire up hub.js and point your browser to it.

## docs
RTFS for now :)
it's not that much
